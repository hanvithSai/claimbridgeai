# ClaimBridge AI

**ClaimBridge AI** is a concept prototype that demonstrates how insurance claims processing in healthcare can be redesigned using AI and automation to reduce delays, errors, and operational bottlenecks.

The project focuses on **workflow transformation and impact**, not regulatory completeness or production readiness.

---

## Problem Statement

Insurance claims processing in hospitals is largely manual and inefficient:

- Patient and treatment data is already digital but repeatedly re-entered
- Insurance teams manually review rule-based approvals
- Limited claims staff become a bottleneck
- Patients face delayed discharge and additional costs
- Communication is slow and indirect

These issues increase operational cost and negatively affect patient experience.

---

## Solution Overview

ClaimBridge AI redesigns the workflow by acting as a **bridge between hospital systems and insurance providers**.

It introduces:
- Automated data ingestion from hospital systems
- AI-assisted claim structuring and validation
- Rule-based and ML-assisted approval flows
- Human-in-the-loop review for edge cases only
- Real-time patient and family notifications

---

## Redesigned Workflow

1. Hospital data is ingested automatically via secure APIs  
2. AI structures clinical and billing data into standard claim formats  
3. Rule-based engine auto-approves or flags claims  
4. Claims agents review exceptions instead of processing everything  
5. Patients receive real-time updates via WhatsApp or SMS

## Key Impact

- Faster claim approvals  
- Reduced patient discharge delays  
- Lower operational cost for hospitals and insurers  
- Fewer manual errors  
- Improved patient and family experience  

---

## High-ROI Insights Enabled

- Average claim approval time by procedure
- Common rejection or delay reasons
- Bottleneck identification across teams
- Agent workload optimization
- Predictive approval likelihood at admission

---

## Tech Stack (Prototype)

- Frontend: React / Next.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Charts: Recharts
- AI Logic: Simulated (rule-based + ML placeholders)

## Disclaimer

This is a **conceptual prototype** created for demonstration and evaluation purposes only.  
It does not handle real patient data and does not claim regulatory compliance.

---

## Why ClaimBridge AI

ClaimBridge AI focuses on **bridging systems, not replacing people**.  
Humans remain decision-makers, while AI removes repetitive work and accelerates outcomes.

Focused on solving real-world problems with minimal resources and maximum impact.
